# Selfie5
Self-contained verification utility for high-throughput random testing of  processors with RISC-V adaptation  

This project provide the source code for the utility to be presented in the DATE Conference (Design, Automation and Test in Europe) 25-27 March 2024  

by following paper:  

*Selfie5: an autonomous, self-contained verification approach for high-throughput random testing of programmable processors*  
Link to be provided upon publication release.   

__Currently setup and running guidelines are under WORK IN PROGRESS, to be accomplished by publication release at towards the above conference.__
